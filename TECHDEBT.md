# General:
ðŸŸ¢- Create github repo from within the cookiecutter using the github CLI
- Setup sonarcloud for the repository automatically
- Setup snyk and sonar tokens using the github CLI
- Use github CLI to call the github API

# sonar-project.properties
- We can deduce the organization and project key from the github repository and github username

# post_gen_project.py:
ðŸŸ¢- Github repository can be composed by the username and repository name (also decreases questions in kata creation)
- Execute smoketest in the end, and don't fail the cookiecutter if the smoketest failes
- Github repository variable name can be improved
- Not all steps actually give the step name to "stop_if_an_error_happened"
- stop_if_an_error_happened does more than the function name suggests
- start_visual_studio: Stop if an error happened

# smoketest.ps1
- Does not need to check if visual studio code is installed, if it is already opened by the post_gen_project.py





# Done:
- Timeout in github api, they are getting mad
